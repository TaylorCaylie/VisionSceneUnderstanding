# VisionSceneUnderstanding

This project combines image processing, feature extraction, clustering and classification methods to achieve basic scene understanding. 

Scene recognition is implemented with small-scale images and nearest neighbor classification -- and then further uses quantized local features and linear classifiers learned by support vector machines
